# Machine learning basics
Plain python implementations of basic machine learning algorithms. All algorithms are implemented from scratch using without additional machine learning libraries.

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Perceptron
- k-nearest-neighbor
- K-Means clustering
- Simple neural network with one hidden layer
