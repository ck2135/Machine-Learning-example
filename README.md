# Machine learning basics

This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms in plain Python (Python Version 3.6+). All algorithms are implemented from scratch without using additional machine learning libraries. The intention of these notebooks is to provide a basic understanding of the algorithms and their underlying structure, *not* to provide the most efficient implementations.

## Data preprocessing

After several requests I started preparing notebooks on how to preprocess datasets for machine learning. In the next months, I will add one notebook for each kind of dataset (text, images, ...). Also for these notebooks the intention is to provide a basic understanding of the preprocessing steps, *not* to provide the most efficient implementations.
